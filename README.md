# Morph Game

## Description
Morph Game is a gamemode made for Overwatch.
It is a proof of concept mode that allows players to morph into enemy heroes after eliminating them.
In order to morph into another hero, you have to move to the location where your victim has been eliminated.
The morph effect will be active for 10 seconds. During that time you can't morph into another hero.
After killing a morphed player, the morph effect for the killed player will be immediately removed.
Additionally a morphed player has a movement speed of 50%, while receiving damages are decreased to 25%.
Team mates and enemies will see morphed players with an appropriate bolt icon through the entire map.
